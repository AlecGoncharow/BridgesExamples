Summary: This assignment outputs a matrix representing repetition in a String.  The students will be providing the loop and conditions for this repetition check.

The students are expected to provide code that iterates over the entire array for each element, checking if the each element is equal to every other element in the array.
An expected answer would be something like:

for (int i = 0; i < wordCount; ++i)
{
	for (int j = 0; j < wordCount; ++j)
	{
		binaryMatrix[i][j] = lyrics[i].equalsIgnoreCase(lyrics[j]) ? 1 : 0;
	}
}

or

for (int i = 0; i < wordCount; ++i)
{
	for (int j = 0; j < wordCount; ++j)
	{
		if (lyrics[i].equalsIgnoreCase(lyrics[j])
			binaryMatrix[i][j] = 1;
	}
}

There are methods provided that will provide cleaned up strings for parsing and take this matrix and convert into a Bridges object to visualize.
