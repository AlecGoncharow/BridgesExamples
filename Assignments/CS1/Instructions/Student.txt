Summary: This assignment outputs a matrix representing repetition in a String.  You will be providing the loop and conditions for this repetition check.

Instructions: An array of Strings has been provided, you must itterate over this array and check each element with every other element, including itself.
In order to check if two Strings are equal to one another I recommend looking at the API for Strings: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
In order to iterate over the array of Strings, I recommend looking into nested loops. 

If you wish to modify the color of the output matrix, you are able to change the RGBA values at the bottom of the provided code.
