Summary: You will be creating a data structure that implements a Dictionary interface, which will take the place of the Hashtable from the Cosine Similarity Matrix assignement.

Instructions: The interface you will be implementing has four methods that handles generics:

public interface Dictionary<K, V>
	V put(K key, V value);
		Stores the Key Value pair in your data structure, returns old value if the key was already assigned.
		
	V get(K key);
		Returns the value linked to the given key
		
	ArrayList<K> getKeySet();
		Returns an ArrayList of all the keys

	ArrayList<V> getValueSet();
		Returns an ArrayList of all the values
		
You can implement this with a variety of different data structures: arrays, linked lists, binary trees.
